I examined Gross Domestic Product data and Education Statistics from the World Bankâ€™s website. The data contained information on the Gross Domestic Product and relative rankings of 190 countries and Education Statistics including income levels for those countries. After cleaning and merging the data sets, the GDP data was analyzed to see if there are any notable trends between income group and GDP.

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
